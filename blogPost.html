            Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) has again named Sinergia Animal as a recommended charity, meaning we have
            made some of the greatest gains for animals in the whole global animal protection movement. ACE is an
            independent research organization dedicated to identifying the most cost-effective ways to help animals.
            Sinergia Animal has been recommended because, following a detailed evaluation, ACE has concluded it is one
            of the handful of nonprofits where your donations will go the farthest.
            This year ACE’s ranking system has changed. Recommended charities are no longer split into two tiers: Top
            and Standout. Now, all 11 selected charities are awarded the same rank: Recommended.
            “We could not be prouder to be named as a Recommended Charity.” Carolina Galvani, Sinergia Animal’s
            Executive Director, said. “This achievement represents months of tireless work, taking on some of the
            biggest companies and institutions in the world. It represents thousands of animal lives changed for the
            better; and millions of carbon footprints reduced. At the end of the day, this ACE recommendation was only
            possible because of our dedicated and passionate team, and, above all, our supporters. You are the backbone
            of everything we do. Thank you for fighting for the animals alongside us.”
